There was a check for number of '-' in the string and then to check there was '----' in row when the positions 7,15,23,31 were stringed together

Next there was a check for special characters in each subsection (rax was passed in as arg so 8 chars each time)
So it was between like 0x22-0x2b and 0x3b-0x40 (these counted as special chars)
First section needed at least 1 special char
Second at least two etc


[user@macbook Downloads]$ ./de_mucholoko check "abcdef*-hijkl**-nopq***-stu****-wx*****"

I don't know if its unintended or not but 
all *s and having 4 hyphens in the right place allowed flag generation
