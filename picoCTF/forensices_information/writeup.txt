the first thing I'd look for on a forensic CTFs are weird codes that usually represent something
focus your attention to this line:

  <cc:license rdf:resource='cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9'/>

especially this string:
    cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9
  
now, the first thing I'd suspect for is Base64 encoding, because that is very common on entry CTFs like this one
as the tools are available online and easy to use

quick online Base64 decoding show that this decodes to:
picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}
bingo
